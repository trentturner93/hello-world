**About Me**
>My name is Trent Turner. I graduated from [Northern Kentucky University](https://www.nku.edu/) with a bachelor's degree in mathematics. After graduating, I worked a few different jobs in the food service industry before starting my own small business. I'm looking forward to classes starting and learning how to code!
